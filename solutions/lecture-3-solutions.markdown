## Exercises

1. Complete `vimtutor`. Note: it looks best in a [80x24](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VT100) (80 columns by 24 lines) terminal window
    {: .fw-500 }

    Type `vimtutor` in the terminal. It will take around 25-30 minutes to get through all the 7 chapters.

    The terminal can be resized by changing your terminal settings accordingly. I have outlined the process for Windows Terminal (which I use) below.

    - Click on the 'Settings' option in dropdown.
    
    ![Click on the 'Settings' option in dropdown](/images/Windows-terminal-1.jpg "Click on the 'Settings' option in dropdown.")

    - Scroll down to the bottom of the 'Startup' tab.

    ![Scroll down to the bottom of the 'Startup' tab](/images/Windows-terminal-2.jpg "Scroll down to the bottom of the 'Startup' tab.")

    - Adjust the number of columns and the number of rows and click on 'Save'.

    ![Scroll down to the bottom of the 'Startup' tab](/images/Windows-terminal-3.jpg "Scroll down to the bottom of the 'Startup' tab.")

    - Close 'Windows Terminal' and restart the application.

1. Download our [basic vimrc](/2020/files/vimrc) and save it to `~/.vimrc`. Read
   through the well-commented file (using Vim!), and observe how Vim looks and
   behaves slightly differently with the new config.

   Self-explanatory.
