All the shell commands and scripts mentioned here are **my version of solutions** to the exercises of **MIT's Missing Semester 2020** course. I've added some explanations with the code along with some reference links for additional information. Please feel free to give suggestions in case you find something wrong in the commands/scripts or if something could be implemented more efficiently.

Also if you like the content please give a star to the repo on [Github here](https://github.com/himalayasharma).
